I am a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at the School of Politics and Global Studies at Arizona State University.
My research investigates peace and conflict, political violence, and human rights with a focus on three main areas: 
1) the strategic decision-making of non-state armed groups, 
2) the causes and impacts of local agreements between non-state armed groups and civilian communities in civil wars, and 
3) the international dimensions of civil wars, including the role of sanctions and military interventions.
My work employs a combination of machine learning, network analysis, prediction, text-as-data, large language models, and quantitative methods.

My book project, <em>Local Peace Agreements in Civil Wars: Legitimacy, Violence, and Conflict Trajectories</em>, examines why non-state armed groups and communities negotiate and sign local agreements during ongoing wars and how these settlements shape intrastate conflict dynamics. 
Drawing on an original dynamic network dataset of local peace agreements in the Central African Republic, I develop a machine learning based prediction framework that demonstrate how these pacts recalibrate power balances, influence patterns of civilian victimization, and reshape interactions among armed actors. 

I pursue related research on political economy of security and conflict. In collaboration with Timothy Peterson and Dursun Peksen, I am working on a project on international economic restrictions using large language models and machine learning. I also study how international interventions influence conflict processes and termination.

I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Pittsburgh in 2025. Previously, I completed an M.A. in International Relations at Koç University and a B.A. in Political Science and International Relations at Boğaziçi University.
